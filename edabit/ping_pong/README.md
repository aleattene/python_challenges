## Ping Pong!

A game of table tennis almost always sounds like _Ping!_ followed by _Pong!_ Therefore, you know that Player 2 has won if you hear _Pong!_ as the last sound (since Player 1 didn't return the ball back).

Given a list of _Ping!_, create a function that inserts _Pong!_ in between each element. Also:

-   If `win` equals `True`, end the list with _Pong!_.
-   If `win` equals `False`, end with _Ping!_ instead.


### Examples
``` ruby
ping_pong(["Ping!"], True) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!"]

ping_pong(["Ping!", "Ping!"], False) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!"]

ping_pong(["Ping!", "Ping!", "Ping!"], True) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!", "Pong!"]
```
