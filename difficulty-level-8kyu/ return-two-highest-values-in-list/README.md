## Return Two Highest Values in List

<p align="justify">

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there are less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible.

The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

For example:

``` ruby
[4, 10, 10, 9]  =>  [10, 9]
[1, 1, 1]  =>  [1]
[]  =>  []
```
